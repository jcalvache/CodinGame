  The Goal
The goal for your program is to safely land the "Mars Lander" shuttle, the landing ship which contains the Opportunity rover. Mars Lander is guided by a program, and right now the failure rate for landing on the NASA simulator is unacceptable.

Note that it may look like a difficult problem, but in reality the problem is easy to solve. This puzzle is the first level among three, therefore, we need to present you some controls you won't need in order to complete this first level.
  Rules

Built as a game, the simulator puts Mars Lander on a limited zone of Mars sky.
The zone is 7000m wide and 3000m high.

For this level, Mars Lander is above the landing zone, in vertical position, with no initial speed.

There is a unique area of flat ground on the surface of Mars, which is at least 1000 meters wide.
Every second, depending on the current flight parameters (location, speed, fuel ...), the program must provide the new desired tilt angle and thrust power of Mars Lander:
Angle goes from -90° to 90° . Thrust power goes from 0 to 4 .

For this level, you only need to control the thrust power: the tilt angle should be 0.
The game simulates a free fall without atmosphere. Gravity on Mars is 3.711 m/s² . For a thrust power of X, a push force equivalent to X m/s² is generated and X liters of fuel are consumed. As such, a thrust power of 4 in an almost vertical position is needed to compensate for the gravity on Mars.

For a landing to be successful, the ship must:

    land on flat ground
    land in a vertical position (tilt angle = 0°)
    vertical speed must be limited ( ≤ 40m/s in absolute value)
    horizontal speed must be limited ( ≤ 20m/s in absolute value)


Remember that this puzzle was simplified:

    the landing zone is just below the shuttle. You can therefore ignore rotation and always output 0 as the target angle.
    you don't need to store the coordinates of the surface of Mars to succeed.
    you only need your vertical landing speed to be between 0 and 40m/s – your horizontal speed being nil.
    As the shuttle falls, the vertical speed is negative. As the shuttle flies upward, the vertical speed is positive.

  Note
For this first level, Mars Lander will go through a single test.

Tests and validators are only slightly different. A program that passes a given test will pass the corresponding validator without any problem.
